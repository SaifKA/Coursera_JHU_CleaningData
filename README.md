# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Purpose of the project

1. Create a tidy data set from [raw data found here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
2. Link a github repo with script to perform step-1
3. Add a code book detailing all the variables and data transformations

## Instructions to achieve the purpose

1. Load up run_analysis.R script in R or RStudio and run the scripts to get the tidy dataset
2. This is the repo which is required for step-2
3. CodeBook.md file contains all the variable details and data transformations for the code file
